Overview

This project is a full-stack weather application that allows users to search for real-time weather information by any Indian city name, view the results instantly, and maintain a searchable weather history in MongoDB.
It also includes a smart caching mechanism to reduce external API calls to OpenWeatherMap.  

Created a Caching Mechanism in which When a user searches a city, the backend first checks the MongoDB database for existing weather data and If found than returns it directly from the database.
And if not found than fetches fresh data from OpenWeatherMap through API, saves it in MongoDB, and sends it to the frontend.

And created a delete Search History API that separatly allows to deleting old search history entries from the database.

Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.

Uses Weather.js plugin in React for easy data handling.
